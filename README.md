# MichiganLabs Android Studio/IntelliJ Project file templates

Copy the `.idea` folder into the root of your new project **after importing it**. Every time you re-import an IntelliJ project, the `.idea` folder will be wiped out and reset to defaults. If you copy in the `.idea` template before importing your project, it will overrite the settings.

If you make changes to project level settings to enable new inspections, change style guidelines, etc, be sure to update this repo with your changes.

Theoretically, this folder could be tracked as a git submodule so it could be synced between this repo and other projects easily.
